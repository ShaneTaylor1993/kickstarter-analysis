# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Conducted analysis on Kickstarter data to find outcomes in relation to a campaigns launch date and funding goal.

### Purpose
Finding campaign outcomes in relation to their launch date and funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
Louise was interested in Theater outcomes in relation to their launch dates so I created a pivot table showing theater campaign's outcomes based on which month they launched. Louise was also interested in Play outcomes based on their funding goals so I created a table showing the outcomes of each play based on what the funding goal was.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In my analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Dates, the data shows that the most successful months to launch a campaign were April-July, with May being the most successful. However, these were also the months with the highest amount of failed campaigns as well. The data shows that there were 30% more successful campaign launches than failed in May. ![Theater Outcomes vs Launch Dates]("C:\Users\Shane\OneDrive\Documents\00 Data Analytics Bootcamp\Module 1 - Excel\Crowdfunding_Analysis\Challenge 1\Resources\Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png")

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In my analysis of the Outcomes based on Goals, I discovered that campaign launched for less that $1000 had the highest success rate of about 76%. The more the campaign goal amount increased, there was a decrease in their success. There were successful campaigns launched for the goal amount of $35000-$44999 and the success rate for those campaign all together was about 67% from a total of 9 campaigns launched. ![Outcomes vs Goals]("C:\Users\Shane\OneDrive\Documents\00 Data Analytics Bootcamp\Module 1 - Excel\Crowdfunding_Analysis\Challenge 1\Resources\Outcomes_vs_Goal.png")

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges I encountered was coming to a conclusion on whether launching a campaign between the amounts of $35000-$44999 should be considered being that there were so few launched in between those amounts but the success rate was fairly close to the success rate of campaigns lauched below a goal amount of less than $1000.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
I've come to the conclusion that April-July are the most successful months to launch a campaign, but were also the months with the most failed campaigns as well. Being that there were about 30% more successful campaigns during these months, I would recommend launching a campaign during them.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I've come to the conclusion that launching a campaign for less than $1000 had the highest success rate. Also the more the campaign goal increased, the success rate decreased. The success rates from les than $1000-$14999 all were higher than the fail rates so I would recommend launching a campaign in between those amounts.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations of the dataset I created on Outcomes based on Goals is that it doesn't show how long these campaigns lasted. There is a jump in successful campaigns for the goal amounts of $35000-$44999 and this could be due to how long these campaigns were held but I cannot get that from the data I created.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would create a table showing how long campaigns ran compared to their goal amounts and compare them.
